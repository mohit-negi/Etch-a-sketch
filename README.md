## Concepts learned from this

- Use of container.style.gridTemplateRows = `repeat(${rows}, 1fr)` to create rows and columns
- Associating value of the dropdown menu with the value of a function

### Process 

1. Created a container and then added style to it.
2. Then populated it with the grids with the help of for loop
- Use of container.style.gridTemplateRows = `repeat(${rows}, 1fr)` to create rows and columns
- Use of for loop to generate desired number of rows and columns
3. Then added multiple buttons with the js to change the mouseover color of te
4. Added an EventListener to the buttons after clicking it the color of the grids will be changed 
    according to it
    1. Button is then added a for loop for which changes the color of the grid to desired color
5. Added Multiple buttons for different colors and to reset color
